# Beyond EVs: Electric Vehicles Data Analysis

We are performing an analysis of electric vehicles, specifically of what factors are associated with electric vehicle adoption, how we can model and forecast EV adoption towards the future, how existing electrical infrastructure needs to change to adapt to increased EV adoption rates, and how can we display our findings clearly.

Our project is comprised of four major parts:
- Exploratory data analysis of an electric vehicle population in a certain geographic area.
- Constructing a machine learning model that forecasts electric vehicle adoption in the area.
- Feeding the output of the forecasting model as an input to another model that determines the sustainability of electrical infrastructure given increased adoption of EVs.
- Creating a map that displays which areas of the geographic area is most susceptible to strain on their electrical infrastructure due to EVs.

## Running the Code
The code is all localized to a Jupyter notebook, so to run the code, you must either:

1. Install the Jupyter notebook through `pip` or `conda` by following the instructions here: https://jupyter.org/install
2. Download a Python 3 Anaconda distribution through this site: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
